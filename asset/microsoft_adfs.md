# ADFS Event ID's

| ID | Event Name | Event Description | Windows |
|-|-|-|-|
| 100 | FsServiceStart | The Federation Service started successfully. The following service hosts have been added: %1  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 102 | StartupException | There was an error in enabling endpoints of Federation Service. Fix configuration errors using PowerShell cmdlets and restart the Federation Service. Additional Data Exception details: %1  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 103 | FsServiceStop | The Federation Service stopped successfully.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |

User Action Make sure that the artifact resolution service is configured properly. Or disable token replay detection by using the Set-ADFSProperties cmdlet with the PreventTokenReplays parameter in Windows PowerShell for AD FS.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 105 | AuthMethodLoadError | An error occurred loading an authentication provider. Fix configuration errors using PowerShell cmdlets and restart the Federation Service. Identifier: %1 Context: %2 Additional Data Exception details: %3  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 106 | AuthMethodLoadSuccess | An authentication provider was successfully loaded: Identifier: '%1', Context: '%2'  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 111 | WsTrustRequestProcessingError | The Federation Service encountered an error while processing the WS-Trust request. Request type: %1 Additional Data Exception details: %2  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 131 | BadConfigurationFormatError | During processing of the Federation Service configuration, the element '%1' was found to have invalid data. The configured value '%2' could not be parsed as type '%3'. Element: %1 Value: %2 Type: %3 The Federation Service will not be able to start until this configuration element is corrected. User Action Correct the specified configuration element to conform to the given type.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 132 | BadConfigurationValueMissing | During processing of the Federation Service configuration, the required element '%1' was missing. Element: %1 The Federation Service will not be able to start until this configuration element is configured. User Action Configure the specified configuration element using the AD FS Management snap-in.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 133 | BadConfigurationIdentityCertificateHasNoPrivateKey | During processing of the Federation Service configuration, the element '%1' was found to have invalid data. The private key for the certificate that was configured could not be accessed. The following are the values of the certificate: Element: %1 Subject: %2 Thumbprint: %3 storeName: %4 storeLocation: %5 Federation Service identity: %6 The Federation Service will not be able to start until this configuration element is corrected. This condition can occur when the certificate is found in the specified store but there is a problem accessing the certificate's private key. Common causes for this condition include the following: (1) The certificate was installed from a source that did not include the private key, such as a .cer or .p7b file. (2) The certificate's private key was imported (for example, from a .pfx file) into a store that is different from the store specified above. (3) The certificate was generated as part of a certificate request that did not specify the "Machine Key" option. (4) The Federation Service identity '%6' has not been granted read access to the certificate's private key. User Action If the certificate was imported from a source with no private key, choose a certificate that does have a private key, or import the certificate again from a source that includes the private key (for example, a .pfx file). If the certificate was imported in a user context, verify that the store specified above matches the store the certificate was imported into. If the certificate was generated by a certificate request that did not specify the "Machine Key" option and the key is marked as exportable, export the certificate with a private key from the user store to a .pfx file and import it again directly into the store specified in the configuration file. If the key is not marked as exportable, request a new certificate using the "Machine Key" option. If the Federation Service identity has not been granted read access to the certificate's private key, correct this condition using the Certificates snap-in.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 134 | BadConfigurationCertificateNotFound | During processing of the Federation Service configuration, the element '%1' was found to have invalid data. The certificate that was identified by the findValue '%2' could not be found. Element: %1 storeName: %3 storeLocation: %4 x509FindType: %5 findValue: %2 The Federation Service will not be able to start until this configuration element is corrected. This condition occurs when the findValue that is specified does not match any certificate in the specified store. Common causes for this condition include the following: (1) The certificate with the specified findValue is from a store that is different from the configured store. (2) The certificate was deleted from the store after configuration. User Action If the certificate exists in a different store, find the location using the certificates snap-in and correct the configuration appropriately. If the certificate has been deleted, configure a different certificate.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
| 135 | BadConfigurationMultipleCertificatesMatch | During processing of the Federation Service configuration, the element '%1' was found to have invalid data. The certificate that was identified by the findValue '%2' was not unique. Element: %1 storeName: %3 storeLocation: %4 x509FindType: %5 findValue: %2 The Federation Service will not be able to start until this configuration element is corrected. This condition can occur when the certificate is found in the specified store but there is more than one certificate that matches the findValue. User Action If the certificate was identified by name and there are multiple certificates of the same name, configure the certificate using the certificate thumbprint.  | 2012 R2,2016,2019 |
