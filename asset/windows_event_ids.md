This event indicates a "hole" in your audit trail and should be avoided with the implementation of an effective log management solution that collects events before they can be overwritten or before the log fills up.  "Do not overwrite events (clear log manually)" should only be used in conjunction with the security option "Audit: Shutdown system immediately if unable to log security audits".  Of course these 2 settings together will cause the system outages if the log is allowed to fill up and would only be appropriate for systems with the highest integrity requirements on audit trails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2010 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

Perhaps this is because the event logging service stops first (event 1100). This is funny since the same problem used to happen in NT.  MS fixed it in 2000 and looks like they broke it again at least as of RC1. I haven't been able to produce this event. Have you? If so, please start a discussion (see above) and post a sample along with any comments you may have!

An authentication package is a DLL that encapsulates a given form of authentication, such as NTLM or Kerberos. The Local Security Authority calls into the appropriate authentication package during the logon process to find out if the user is authentic.   Although a third party can develop an authentication package, few do so, except for smart card and token manufacturers. The only authentication package logged by Windows Server 2008 is C:\Windows\system32\msv1_0.dll : MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0 which is just one of the authentication options supported by Windows (See 514 for a list of standard authentication packages on Windows Server 2003). The other authentication options supported by Windows Server 2008 appear to now be part of a larger package called a security package. See 4622.  From MSDN: "A security package that functions as an authentication package and implements the functionality required by SSPI is called a security support provider/authentication package (SSP/AP)."  The security implication of event 4610, realistically, is low. Although a rogue package could cause great harm by stealing credentials at the time of logon, the effort required in developing and installing a rogue authentication package is significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

A logon process is a trusted part of the operating system and handles the overall logon function for different logon methods including incoming RAS connections, RunAs, interactive logons initiated by CtrlAltDel, and network logons (as in drive mappings).   Because logon processes are such trusted functions, a rogue logon process would be a devastating security breach--but an improbable one, given the effort and skill required.

I haven't been able to produce this event. Have you? If so, please start a discussion (see above) and post a sample along with any comments you may have! Don't forget to sanitize any private information.Microsoft reports they have tested logging to over 10,000 events per second. However a bottleneck in disk I/O or other resources could also cause a problem.

Notification packages are DLLs that Windows calls into whenenever a user changes his/her password. The purpose of a notification package is to let you evaluate passwords against your own rules for acceptability. The notification package answers back whether or not the password is acceptable. Notification packages are also used to implement password synchronization systems.   A rogue notification package would be a devastating security breach because notification packages are supplied with the clear text of the password and are simpler to write and install than authentication packages and logon processes (see 4610, 4611, and 4622).Standard notification packages for Windows server 2008:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

Process information shows the program that was used to change the time.  Changing the time manually from the taskbar uses rundll.exe as shown in the example.It is routine to see this event where subject is "LOCAL SERVICE", process name is "svchost.exe"  and can be ignored. You will see this event logged twice in a row for whatever reason.Events showing a change by an actual user and a process like rundll.exe indicate a time change outside the normal Windows Time Service.The format of date/time changes from Win2008 and Win2012 as shown in the examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

I rebooted, reset the CrashOnAuditFail registry setting, cleared the log and restarted.  The event was never logged. I haven't been able to produce this event. Have you?

MSDN defines a security package as "The software implementation of a security protocol. Security packages are contained in security support provider DLLs or security support provider/authentication package DLLs." From http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380130.aspx: Windows operating system supports authentication using security packages that function as both security support providers and as authentication packages. Security packages provide the logon process support services of a Windows authentication package and also provide authentication services to applications by implementing a set of functions that are mapped to the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI). The security implication of event 4622 realistically, is low. Although a rogue package could cause great harm by stealing credentials at the time of logon, the effort required in developing and installing a rogue security package is significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

See New Logon for who just logged on to the sytem.Remaining logon information fields are new to Windows 10/2016This is a valuable piece of information as it tells you HOW the user just logged on:       Logon Type   Description    2 Interactive (logon at keyboard and screen of system)   3 Network (i.e. connection to shared folder on this computer from elsewhere on network)   4 Batch (i.e. scheduled task)   5 Service (Service startup)   7 Unlock (i.e. unnattended workstation with password protected screen saver)   8 NetworkCleartext (Logon with credentials sent in the clear text. Most often indicates a logon to IIS with "basic authentication") See this article for more information.   9 NewCredentials such as with RunAs or mapping a network drive with alternate credentials.  This logon type does not seem to show up in any events.  If you want to track users attempting to logon with alternate credentials see 4648.  MS says "A caller cloned its current token and specified new credentials for outbound connections. The new logon session has the same local identity, but uses different credentials for other network connections."   10 RemoteInteractive (Terminal Services, Remote Desktop or Remote Assistance)   11 CachedInteractive (logon with cached domain credentials such as when logging on to a laptop when away from the network)    From MSDN    Anonymous Anonymous COM impersonation level that hides the identity of the caller. Calls to WMI may fail with this impersonation level.   Default Default impersonation.   Delegate Delegate-level COM impersonation level that allows objects to permit other objects to use the credentials of the caller. This level, which will work with WMI calls but may constitute an unnecessary security risk, is supported only under Windows 2000.   Identify Identify-level COM impersonation level that allows objects to query the credentials of the caller. Calls to WMI may fail with this impersonation level.   Impersonate Impersonate-level COM impersonation level that allows objects to use the credentials of the caller. This is the recommended impersonation level for WMI calls.    The user who just logged on is identified by the Account Name and Account Domain.  You can determine whether the account is local or domain by comparing the Account Domain to the computer name.  If they match, the account is a local account on that system, otherwise a domain account.This section identifies WHERE the user was when he logged on.  Of course if logon is initiated from the same computer this information will either be blank or reflect the same local computers.  | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

One or more of these events are logged whenever a user logs on or a logon session begins for any other reason (see LogonTypes on 4624).This event documents all the groups to which the user belongs.This event is not really an event per se but a point-in-time documentation of the user's membership at the time of logon.Identifies the account that requested the logon - NOT the user who just logged on.  Subject is usually Null or one of the Service principals and not usually useful information.  See New Logon for who just logged on to the sytem.This is a valuable piece of information as it tells you HOW the user just logged on.  See 4624  The user who just logged on is identified by the Account Name and Account Domain.  You can determine whether the account is local or domain by comparing the Account Domain to the computer name.  If they match, the account is a local account on that system, otherwise a domain account.

This event signals the end of a logon session and can be correlated back to the logon event 4624 using the Logon ID.  For network connections (such as to a file server), it will appear that users log on and off many times a day. This phenomenon is caused by the way the Server service terminates idle connections.   If a user turns off his/her computer, Windows does not have an opportunity to log the logoff event until the system restarts. Therefore, some logoff events are logged much later than the time at which they actually occur.   ANONYMOUS LOGONs are routine events on Windows networks.  Microsoft's comments:  This event does not necessarily indicate the time that a user has stopped using a system. For example, if the computer is shut down or loses network connectivity it may not record a logoff event at all.   Logon Type: indicates how the user was logged on.

This event seems to be in place of 4634 in the case of Interactive and RemoteInteractive (remote desktop) logons.  This is a plus since it makes it easier to distinguish between logoffs resulting from an idle network session and logoffs where the user actually logs off with from his console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

For instance logging on interactively to a member server (Win2008 RC1) with a domain account produces an instance of this event in addition to 2 instances of 4624.This is the original account that started a process or connection using new credentials.  In this case Administrator was logged on to the local computer.These are the new credentials.  In this case Administrator then logged on as rsmith@mtg.com.This is the server (in this case a Sharepoint server) Administrator logged on to as rsmith@mtg.com.  This section may be blank or indicate the local computer when starting another process on local computer. This is the process that initiates the connection or new process.  In this case it makes sense that it's Internet Explorer since we're accessing a Sharepoint site. The Process Name identifies the program executable that processed the logon.  This is one of the trusted logon processes identified by 4611. Process ID is the process ID specified when the executable started as logged in 4688. This is blank in many cases but in the case of Remote Desktop logons network address is filled in with the IP address of the client workstation.  Source port, while filled in, is not useful since most protocol source ports are random.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

When you enable auditing on an object (e.g. file or folder), this is the first event recorded when an application attempts to access the object in such a way that matches the audit policy defined for that object in terms of who is requesting the access and what type of access is being requested. (it appears that two subcategories must be enabled, Handle Manipulation and one other such as File System or Registry depending on what type of object you are auditing.)This event will be Audit Success or Audit Failure depending on whether the user account under which the account is running has the requested permissions or not. This event's sub category will vary depending on type of object. In the example above notepad.exe running as Administrator successfully opened "New Text Document.txt" for Read access.This event does not always mean any access successfully requested was actually exercised - just that it was successfully obtained (if the event is Audit Success of course).  To determine if any of the permissions requested were actually exercised look forward in the log for 4663 with the same Handle ID.Win2012 adds 2 new fields: Resource Attributes and Access Reasons.The user and logon session that performed the action.This is the object upon whom the action was attempted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

In addition to this event you will also get event 4663 when you delete the object; Accesses: will include DELETE. 4663 identifies the object's name without requiring correlation to 4656.The user and logon session that deleted the object.This is the object just deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

Most objects, when opened (handle request), generate event 4656 but when you open a SAM object you get 4661 instead.  Some AD objects also double as SAM objects and some properties of those objects double as SAM attributes.  This event is logged when opening such SAM objects such as SAM_DOMAIN or SAM_USER.   When the object is closed you get event ID 4658 with the same handle ID.  I regard these events as noise and recommend disabling the SAM subcategory in your audit policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Directory Service Access                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | A handle to an object was requested      |

Of course the object's audit policy must be enabled for the permissions requested and the user requesting it or a group to which that user belongs.  For tracking property level changes to AD objects I recommend using Directory Service Change events (5136...) instead of this event because 5136, etc provide much better information.    On the other hand this is the only event that reports accesses defined for auditing that do not qualify as property changes. For instance changing the permissions on an OU such as for delegating administrative authority requires the WRITE_DAC permission which would get logged by this event.Of course I don't recommend auditing read only accesses on AD objects since the value is questionable and would typically generate many, many events.  So on the whole I regard this event as noise and recommend disabling the "Directory Service Access" subcategory in your audit policy on domain controllers.The user and logon session that performed the action.

This event documents actual operations performed against files and other objects.  This event is logged between the open (4656) and close (4658) events for the object being opened and can be correlated to those events via Handle ID.    While event 4656 tells you when the object is initially opened and what type of access was requested at that time; 4656 doesn't give you positive confirmation any of the access permissions were actually exercised.  That is the role of this event.  This event, 4663, is logged the first time one or more of the requested permissions are actually exercised.  If the program repeatedly exercises a permission while the object is open, Windows only logs 4663 the first time.Note events 4656 and 4658 will not appear unless the subcategory "Handle Manipulation" is enabled along with the target sub-category. Microsoft explains that this was done to make it more difficult to enable these noisy events.

The event identifies the object, who changed the permissions and the old an new permissions.  Of course the object's audit policy must have auditing enabled for "Write DAC"/"Change Permissions" or "Take Ownership" permissions for the user who just modified this object's access control list or a group to which the user belongs.Also, this event is logged based on the status of the Object Access subcategory - not the status of "Authorization Policy Change" subcategory.  For instance to log this event for file permission changes, the "File System" subcategory must be enabled for success.Note the following problem is fixed in more recent versions of Windows.  Definitely in Windows 8/2012.  Not sure about Win7 and Win2008R2: This event has been observed as above after deleting an access control entry from the file's ACL.  However the event was not logged after simply blocking permission inheritance and copying existing ACEs.

For instance you will see event 4672 in close proximity to logon events (4624) for administrators since administrators have most of these admin-equivalent rights.    So, this is a useful right to detecting any "super user" account logons.  Of course this right is logged for any server or applications accounts logging on as a batch job (scheduled task) or system service.  See Logon Type: on event ID 4624.  You can correlate 4672 to 4624 by Logon ID:.  Note: "User rights" and "privileges" are synonymous terms used interchangeably in Windows.  Admin-equivalent rights are powerful authorities that allow you to circumvent other security controls in Windows.  Most admin equivalent privileges are intended for services and applications that interact closely with the operating system.  With just a few exceptions, most admin equivalent privileges neither need nor should be granted to human user accounts.Some Microsoft documentation puts this in the "Sensitive Privilege Use / Non-Sensitive Privilege Use" subcategory. However our testing finds this in the "Special Logon" Category.The ID and logon session of the administrator-equivalent user that just logged on.The names of all the admin-equivalent privileges the user held at the time of logon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |

Note: "User rights" and "privileges" are synonymous terms used interchangeably in Windows.  Some user rights are logged by this event - others by 4674. Still other, ""high-volume"" rights are not logged when they are exercised unless you enable the security option "Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege".    Unfortunately, Microsoft has overloaded these privileges so that each privilege may govern your authority to perform many different operations and which privilege is required for which operations is not well documented.  Therefore seeing that a privilege was exercised doesn't really tell you much.  In Win2008 this has been improved with better information in the Server: and Service Name: fields.  In general though, I still classify these events as noise.  Microsoft admits: "These are high volume events, which typically do not contain sufficient information to act upon since they do not describe what operation occurred."  Note: 4673 and 4674 do not log any activity associated with Logon Rights such as the SeNetworkLogonRight. Do not confuse events 4673 and 4674 with events  4717 and 4718 which document rights assignment changes as opposed to the exercise of rights which is the purpose of events 4673 and 4674.   Subject:  The ID and logon session of the user that excercised the right. Service:  These fields help you narrow down what the user exercised the the right for. Start a discussion below if you have information on these fields!  Process Information:  These fields tell you the program that exercised the right. The Process Name identifies the program executable.  Process ID is the process ID specified when the executable started as logged in 4688.Service Request Information: Privileges: The names of the privileges just exercised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2012 R2, 7, 2012 R2, 8.1, 2016, 10, 2019 |
